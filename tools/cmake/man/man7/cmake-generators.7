.SH INTRODUCTION
.sp
A \fICMake Generator\fP is responsible for writing the input files for
a native build system.  Exactly one of the \fI\%CMake Generators\fP must be
selected for a build tree to determine what native build system is to
be used.  Optionally one of the \fI\%Extra Generators\fP may be selected
as a variant of some of the \fI\%Command\-Line Build Tool Generators\fP to
produce project files for an auxiliary IDE.
.sp
CMake Generators are platform\-specific so each may be available only
on certain platforms.  The \fBcmake(1)\fP command\-line tool \fB\-\-help\fP
output lists available generators on the current platform.  Use its \fB\-G\fP
option to specify the generator for a new build tree.
The \fBcmake\-gui(1)\fP offers interactive selection of a generator
when creating a new build tree.
.SH CMAKE GENERATORS
.SS Command\-Line Build Tool Generators
.sp
These generators support command\-line build tools.  In order to use them,
one must launch CMake from a command\-line prompt whose environment is
already configured for the chosen compiler and build tool.
.SS Borland Makefiles
.sp
Generates Borland makefiles.
.SS MSYS Makefiles
.sp
Generates MSYS makefiles.
.sp
The makefiles use /bin/sh as the shell.  They require msys to be
installed on the machine.
.SS MinGW Makefiles
.sp
Generates a make file for use with mingw32\-make.
.sp
The makefiles generated use cmd.exe as the shell.  They do not require
msys or a unix shell.
.SS NMake Makefiles
.sp
Generates NMake makefiles.
.SS NMake Makefiles JOM
.sp
Generates JOM makefiles.
.SS Ninja
.sp
Generates build.ninja files (experimental).
.sp
A build.ninja file is generated into the build tree.  Recent versions
of the ninja program can build the project through the "all" target.
An "install" target is also provided.
.SS Unix Makefiles
.sp
Generates standard UNIX makefiles.
.sp
A hierarchy of UNIX makefiles is generated into the build tree.  Any
standard UNIX\-style make program can build the project through the
default make target.  A "make install" target is also provided.
.SS Watcom WMake
.sp
Generates Watcom WMake makefiles.
.SS IDE Build Tool Generators
.sp
These generators support Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
project files.  Since the IDEs configure their own environment
one may launch CMake from any environment.
.SS Visual Studio 6
.sp
Generates Visual Studio 6 project files.
.SS Visual Studio 7
.sp
Generates Visual Studio .NET 2002 project files.
.SS Visual Studio 7 .NET 2003
.sp
Generates Visual Studio .NET 2003 project files.
.SS Visual Studio 8 2005
.sp
Generates Visual Studio 8 2005 project files.
.sp
It is possible to append a space followed by the platform name to
create project files for a specific target platform.  E.g.  "Visual
Studio 8 2005 Win64" will create project files for the x64 processor.
.SS Visual Studio 9 2008
.sp
Generates Visual Studio 9 2008 project files.
.sp
It is possible to append a space followed by the platform name to
create project files for a specific target platform.  E.g.  "Visual
Studio 9 2008 Win64" will create project files for the x64 processor;
"Visual Studio 9 2008 IA64" for Itanium.
.SS Visual Studio 10 2010
.sp
Generates Visual Studio 10 (VS 2010) project files.
.sp
It is possible to append a space followed by the platform name to
create project files for a specific target platform.  E.g.
"Visual Studio 10 2010 Win64" will create project files for the
x64 processor; "Visual Studio 10 2010 IA64" for Itanium.
.sp
For compatibility with CMake versions prior to 3.0, one may specify this
generator using the name "Visual Studio 10" without the year component.
.SS Visual Studio 11 2012
.sp
Generates Visual Studio 11 (VS 2012) project files.
.sp
It is possible to append a space followed by the platform name to
create project files for a specific target platform.  E.g.
"Visual Studio 11 2012 Win64" will create project files for the
x64 processor; "Visual Studio 11 2012 ARM" for ARM.
.sp
For compatibility with CMake versions prior to 3.0, one may specify this
generator using the name "Visual Studio 11" without the year component.
.SS Visual Studio 12 2013
.sp
Generates Visual Studio 12 (VS 2013) project files.
.sp
It is possible to append a space followed by the platform name to
create project files for a specific target platform.  E.g.
"Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64" will create project files for the
x64 processor; "Visual Studio 12 2013 ARM" for ARM.
.sp
For compatibility with CMake versions prior to 3.0, one may specify this
generator using the name "Visual Studio 12" without the year component.
.SS Xcode
.sp
Generate Xcode project files.
.SH EXTRA GENERATORS
.sp
Some of the \fI\%CMake Generators\fP listed in the \fBcmake(1)\fP
command\-line tool \fB\-\-help\fP output may have variants that specify
an extra generator for an auxiliary IDE tool.  Such generator
names have the form \fB<extra\-generator> \- <main\-generator>\fP\&.
The following extra generators are known to CMake.
.SS CodeBlocks
.sp
