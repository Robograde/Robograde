COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>
----------------------------

Per-configuration preprocessor definitions on a source file.

This is the configuration-specific version of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS.
Note that Xcode does not support per-configuration source file flags
so this property will be ignored by the Xcode generator.
